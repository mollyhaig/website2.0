			<h5> Assignment: Create the kind of work you will be making in five years.</h5>

			<p> Lit Lit book design rethinks what it means to read by literally putting the story in your hands. Each book includes a guiding question, an ongoing tactile activity connected to the question, and a highlighter to track words related to the question. Read on for four reasons this is important!  </p>

				<h5> 1. Reading </h5>
				<p> Not all people learn best by reading text, so many students (especially those with common reading disabilities like dyslexia) can benefit from the multisensory instruction. The Lit Lit experience is multisensory because students engage with the reading through high-lighting, planting, chewing, making, melting, etc., not just by looking at text. </p>

					<h5> 2. Attention </h5>
					<p> Lit Lit activities act as a worry stone and multitasking opportunity, both of which have been shown to increase focus in distracted students. The activities also offer motivation through a goal-and-reward structure (ex: chew a piece of gum per chapter) and continue to draw students' attention to the theme of the text. This is useful for all students, but especially those with ADD/ADHD. </p>

						<h5> 3. Analysis Skills </h5>
						<p> All students benefit from learning to track a theme through a text. This kind of critical thinking is useful for class discussions, essays, and understanding the author's craft. The guiding questions, high-lighter, and activity included in Lit Lit books encourage students to track a theme through the novel. </p>

							<h5> 4. Connection </h5>
							<p> Lit Lit books are fun! (lit!) They inspire students to approach literature with fresh eyes (and other senses). Students are much more likely to stick with a text that they feel connected to, and the story-long activities of Lit Lit help to forge this connection.  </p>
